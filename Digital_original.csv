As a software infrastructure, .NET consists of two programming models: Çƒ¢	A Web services programming model, which exposes programming interfaces through Internet standards. This loosely coupled model uses HTTP and other Internet protocols as the main underlying transport mechanisms, and also uses XML, SOAP, WSDL and Universal Description, Discovery and Integration. Initially, most of this model will use a request/reply communications style. Çƒ¢	A system programming model designed to supersede MicrosoftÇs COM and the Windows application programming interfaces over time. This model introduces a new set of fundamental classes and a new runtime environment Çthe Common Language Runtime Çproviding an object-oriented class hierarchy structure as part of the application runtime environment.

AMPS,2,1,"Defined in EIA/TIA-553 standards. In 2006, AMPS is still the most extensive wireless coverage available for nationwide service in the US. However, in 2002, the FCC made the drastic decision to no longer require A and B carriers to support AMPS cellular service as of March 1, 2008. Since the AMPS standard is analog technology, it suffers from an inherently inefficient use of the frequency spectrum. All AMPS carriers have converted most of their consumer base to a digital standard such as CDMA or GSM and continue to do so at a rapid pace. Digital technologies such as CDMA support multiple voice calls on the same channel, superior call quality, enhanced features such as two-way text messaging, voicemail indicator, internet, and GPS services; whereas, AMPS can only support one call per channel and a basic one-way short message service. AMPS cellular service operates in the 800 MHZ FM band. In 1989, the Federal Communications Commission granted carriers an expansion from the current 666 channels to the now 832 (416 per carrier). The additional frequency was available in the upper 800 MHz band which also was home to UHF channels 70-83. This meant that these UHF channels could no longer be used for UHF TV transmission as these frequencies were to be used for AMPS transmission. Reference: Adapted from Wikipedia."

Please note that Gartner no longer classifies supercomputers and mainframes as discrete segments. As the technology, use and positioning differentiation between the server segments has eroded, all multiuser systems are now classified as general-purpose servers. ?	Workstations ÇWorkstations are single-user systems including high-end, midrange, and entry-level workstations. Workstations are typically high-end complex instruction set computer (CISC), explicitly parallel instruction computing or RISC-based CPU architectures with high-performance graphics, OS and system architecture. In general, workstations must include integrated floating-point processing, integrated networking, a 32-bit or 64-bit multitasking OS, as well as configurations that support high-resolution graphics capabilities and 3D graphics functionality. The workstation market includes traditional Unix workstations, such as Linux and workstations running Windows 2000/XP or other advanced OSs. Gartner classifies workstations by the primary market for which they are designed and bases its data collection on desktops branded as workstations. Systems shipped with Windows Media Center Edition are generally counted as PCs and not included in the workstation category and, because they are not branded as workstations, neither are Apple Macintosh desktops. Examples of x86-based workstations are IBMÇs IntelliStation family, Dell Precision Workstations and HP Workstations. Note that the Intel-compatible 32-bit CPU (x86-32) category refers to Intel Architecture (IA)-compatible, x86-based workstations and covers a variety of chipset and processor designs not offered by Intel.

PCs ÇPCs are single-user systems including x86 (Intel-compatible CPU) server, desk-based and mobile PCs. A PC is a general purpose computer that is distinguished from other computers by its adherence to hardware and software compatibility. This compatibility drives high-unit volumes of commoditylike products that do not require on-site technical support. High-performance features, such as networking, graphics and a virtual multiuser/multitasking OS, are normally optional and not integral system features. IBM/IBM-compatible and Apple PCs are two platforms in this product segment. A single-user PCÇs resident OS is typically Windows, Mac OS and Linux. PCs have a performance ceiling that is lower in system compute performance, input/output (I/O) channel speed and disk speed than advanced workstations. Standard graphics are in the 1024 x 768 to 1280 x 1068-pixel range, and optional high-end graphics are limited compared with workstations.

Contact center systems are defined as follows:  They are software applications typically residing on an adjunct server or switch-based processor system, located either at a customerÇs premises or at a third-party site. For routing phone calls, the system providing the call control may be an application-specific resource or may support a dual-function PBX/automatic call distributor installation. Newer architectures will support contact center call routing business rules on an Çapplication serverÇ which can direct and monitor calls through a telephony gateway using SIP or other softswitch protocols. The infrastructure may also be provided as an on-site Çmanaged service;Ç as an off-site, dedicated Çhosted serviceÇ solution; or as an off-site shared resource Çsoftware as a serviceÇ (SaaS) solution.  They provide intelligent routing of an incoming communication (that is, a call, e-mail, text chat, Web collaboration or facsimile) to the appropriate resource (that is, agent-assisted or self-service) through an algorithm more sophisticated than simple hunt groups.  They provide the ability to generate historical activity reports (covering at least 30 days) as well as supervisory capabilities including, but not limited to, real-time monitoring and reporting of a systemÇs workload, agent status lookups, viewing the number of contacts in the queue, and the ability to change agent status."

Data integration tools have traditionally been delivered via a set of related markets, with vendors in each market offering a specific style of data integration tool. In recent years, most of the activity has been within the ETL tool market. Markets for replication tools, data federation (EII) and other submarkets each included vendors offering tools optimized for a particular style of data integration, and periphery markets (such as data quality tools, adapters and data modeling tools) also overlapped with the data integration tool space. The result of all this historical fragmentation in the markets is the equally fragmented and complex way in which data integration is accomplished in large enterprises Çdifferent teams using different tools, with little consistency, lots of overlap and redundancy, and no common management or leverage of metadata. Technology buyers have been forced to acquire a portfolio of tools from multiple vendors to amass the capabilities necessary to address the full range of their data integration requirements. This situation is now changing, with the separate and distinct data integration tool submarkets converging at the vendor and technology levels. This is being driven by buyer demands as organizations realize they need to think about data integration holistically and have a common set of data integration capabilities they can use across the enterprise. It is also being driven by the actions of vendors, such as those in individual data integration submarkets organically expanding their capabilities into neighboring areas, as well as by acquisition activity that brings vendors from multiple submarkets together. The result is a market for complete data integration tools that address a range of different data integration styles and are based on common design tooling, metadata and runtime architecture."

Usually, the working band is near 900 MHz. ESMR can function like its fundamentally simpler cousin, SMR, but it can also offer features similar to those of a cellular telephone network. The PTT (push-to-talk), half-duplex mode can be used; in this case the operation resembles communications between old-style two-way radios. Full-duplex mode can also be used, so either party can listen and talk at the same time. Interconnection with telephone networks is commonly done. In addition to voice communication, an ESMR system can offer paging, wireless fax, and data transmission. ESMR systems use digital radio transmission. Spread-spectrum modes, such as frequency hopping, are common. In a well-designed ESMR system, connection is almost instantaneous, compared with the typical 15 to 20 seconds required to dial and set up a call in a public cellular network. The coverage of an ESMR system depends on the geographical distribution and needs of the users. Some systems are confined to single municipalities; others cover selected groups of metro areas; others operate over entire states or regions of a country.

In addition, these solutions are cloud-data-assisted, meaning the endpoint agent does not have to maintain a local database of all known IOCs, but can check a cloud resource to find the latest verdicts on objects that it is unable to classify."
EQUIVALENT,0,0,"Content is equivalent to other content when both fulfill essentially the same function or purpose upon presentation to the user. In the context of this document, the equivalent must fulfill essentially the same function for the person with a disability (in as feasible a manner as possible given the nature of the disability and the state of technology) as the primary content does for the person without any disability. For example, the text The Full Moon might convey the same information as an image of a full moon when presented to users. Note that equivalent information focuses on fulfilling the same function. If the image is part of a link and understanding the image is crucial to choosing the link target, an equivalent must also give users an idea of the link target."

ERP applications automate and support a range of administrative and operational business processes across multiple industries, including line of business, customer-facing, administrative and the asset management aspects of an enterprise. ERP deployments are complex and expensive endeavors, and some organizations struggle to define the business benefits.  Look for business benefits in four areas: a catalyst for business innovation, a platform for business process efficiency, a vehicle for process standardization, and IT cost savings. Most enterprises focus on the last two areas, because they are the easiest to quantify; however, the first two areas often have the most significant impact on the enterprise."

ESMR,2,1,"A wireless communication system in which numerous mobile/portable transceivers are linked in a network of repeaters. Each repeater has a range of approximately 5 to 10 miles. Operating frequencies are in the UHF (ultra-high frequency) range, that is, between approximately 300 MHz and 3 GHz. Usually, the working band is near 900 MHz. ESMR can function like its fundamentally simpler cousin, SMR, but it can also offer features similar to those of a cellular telephone network. The PTT (push-to-talk), half-duplex mode can be used; in this case the operation resembles communications between old-style two-way radios. Full-duplex mode can also be used, so either party can listen and talk at the same time. Interconnection with telephone networks is commonly done. In addition to voice communication, an ESMR system can offer paging, wireless fax, and data transmission. ESMR systems use digital radio transmission. Spread-spectrum modes, such as frequency hopping, are common. In a well-designed ESMR system, connection is almost instantaneous, compared with the typical 15 to 20 seconds required to dial and set up a call in a public cellular network. The coverage of an ESMR system depends on the geographical distribution and needs of the users. Some systems are confined to single municipalities; others cover selected groups of metro areas; others operate over entire states or regions of a country. Examples of ESMR networks include Ericsson's EDACS (Enhanced Digital Access¨Ü ¨ÜCommunications System), Motorola's IDEN (Integrated Dispatch Enhanced Network), and the Sprint Nextel System.

FTTP is further divided into point-to-point (PTP) FTTP and point-to-multipoint FTTP. PTP FTTP technologies are more expensive to deploy because of a higher fiber count, but have the advantage of offering a dedicated fiber to each end-user location, which makes it possible to share PTP infrastructure between different carriers. Very often, a PTP FTTP deployment has optical Ethernet switches both at the CO and the customer premises. Point-to-multipoint FTTP technology is commonly referred to as passive optical network (PON) technology. There are various types, including broadband PON (BPON), gigabit PON (GPON) and Ethernet PON (EPON). GPON is the most popular for large carriers, although there are significant EPON deployments in Asia/Pacific and Japan. The different types of PON are collectively called xPON.

The data rates will allow users to take part in video conferences and interact with multimedia Web sites and similar applications using mobile handheld devices as well as notebook computers. GPRS is based on Global System for Mobile (GSM) communication and will complement existing services such as circuit-switched cellular phone connections and the Short Message Service (SMS). In theory, GPRS packet-based service should cost users less than circuit-switched services since communication channels are being used on a shared- use, as-packets-are-needed basis rather than dedicated only to one user at a time. It should also be easier to make applications available to mobile users because the faster data rate means that middleware currently needed to adapt applications to the slower speed of wireless systems will no longer be needed. As GPRS becomes available, mobile users of a virtual private network (VPN) will be able to access the private network continuously rather than through a dial-up connection. GPRS will also complement Bluetooth, a standard for replacing wired connections between devices with wireless radio connections. In addition to the Internet Protocol (IP), GPRS supports X.25, a packet-based protocol that is used mainly in Europe.

HOST,2,0,"The term host is used in several contexts, in each of which it has a slightly different meaning:  In Internet protocol specifications, the term host means any computer that has full two-way access to other computers on the Internet. A host has a specific local or host number that, together with the network number, forms its unique IP address. If you use Point-to-Point Protocol to get access to your access provider, you have a unique IP address for the duration of any connection you make to the Internet and your computer is a host for that period. In this context, a host is a node in a network. For companies or individuals with a Web site, a host is a computer with a Web server that serves the pages for one or more Web sites. A host can also be the company that provides that service, which is known as hosting. In IBM and perhaps other mainframe computer environments, a host is a mainframe computer (which is now usually referred to as a large server). In this context, the mainframe has intelligent or dumb terminals (or emulation) attached to it that use it as a host provider of services.

MICRO FUEL CELLS,2,1,"Micro fuel cells are an alternative to batteries as a power source for mobile devices. They may be small enough for integration inside the electronic equipment, or a little larger for use in an external power supply. The majority of portable fuel cells use hydrogen as the base fuel, but micro fuel cells usually extract it from methanolÇƒÓa hydrogen-rich liquid. Although methanol-based cells can potentially provide 10 times the energy storage capacity of a lithium battery, they are not as good at delivering bursts of high power. This makes them more useful for battery charging than for primary power roles. They can be recharged almost instantaneously by adding more methanolÇƒÓby either pouring it in or clipping in a new cartridge. This is a significant advantage over batteries, which can take several hours to recharge. Micro fuel cells are also environmentally friendly; the operating waste is only hydrogen and oxygen, which appears (in the form of pure water) as slightly increased humidity around the cell. Other forms of fuel cell, such as zinc-air and ethanol, are possible fuel sources for mobile devicesÇƒÓbut are currently less prominent."

MIDSIZE ENTERPRISE,0,0,"Gartner defines midsize enterprise (MSE) as those organizations that have between $50 million and $1 billion in annual revenues and/or 100 to 1000 employees. This is a vendor driven segmentation scheme and segmenting midsize enterprises by revenues or number of employees is arbitrary. Midsize enterprise is a term essentially born out of a process of elimination Çit refers to the organizations that are neither Global 2000 enterprises nor small businesses. Midsize enterprises are bound not so much by a similar set of IT needs, but by a similar set of challenges Çmost notably, limitations in IT staffing, skills and funding. The cross-industry average for IT full-time equivalents, as a percent of employees is 5.9% for midsize enterprises. This usually equates to between 10 and 50 internal IT staffers. On average, midsize enterprises spend approximately 4.5% of their annual revenue on IT. In absolute terms, this usually equates to IT budgets between $5 million ÇƒÏ $25 million (see IT Key Metrics Data 2018: Midsize Enterprise Executive Summary).

RAC,2,0,"A component of the Oracle database product that allows a database to be installed across multiple servers. According to Oracle, RAC's shared disk method of clustering databases: increases scalability because servers can easily be added or subtracted to meet current needs, lowers costs because companies don't have to buy high-end servers, and improves availability because if one server fails, another can assume its workload. RAC's shared disk architecture is an unusual approach to database clustering. Most competing database products (such as Microsoft's SQL Server and IBM's DB2 for Windows and Unix environments) use the alternative, which is known as shared nothing architecture. Shared nothing architecture partitions data and only gives each server access to its own disk subsystem, while shared disk architecture gives all servers access to the entire database. This adds failover capacity to the database, because all servers have access to the whole database. Proponents claim that this capacity increases Oracle's reliability and availability significantly. British Telecom, for example, reported that deploying the product enabled them to cut their failover time from a typical 20 minutes to between 10-60 seconds."

REDUCED INSTRUCTION SET COMPUTER,2,1,"A processor architecture that shifts the analytical process of a computational task from the execution or runtime to the preparation or compile time. By using less hardware or logic, the system can operate at higher speeds. RISC cuts down on the number and complexity of instructions, on the theory that each one can be accessed and executed faster, and that less semiconductor real estate is required to process them.

RISC designs emphasize single-cycle execution, even at the expense of synthesizing multi-instruction sequences for some less-frequent operations. Çƒ¢	Hard-wired control, little or no microcode ÇMicrocode adds a layer of interpretive overhead, raising the number of cycles per instruction, so even the simplest instructions can require several cycles. Çƒ¢	Simple instructions, few addressing modes ÇComplex instructions and addressing modes, which entail microcode or multicycle instructions, are avoided. Çƒ¢	Load and store, register-register design ÇOnly loads and stores access memory; all others perform register-register operations. This tends to follow from the previous three principles. Çƒ¢	Efficient, deep pipelining ÇTo make convenient use of hardware parallelism without the complexities of horizontal microcode, fast CPUs use pipelining.

RFID,2,1,"Radio frequency identification (RFID) refers to an automated data collection technology that uses radio frequency waves to transfer data between a reader and a tag to identify, track and locate the tagged item. There are two basic categories of tags used for logistics and transportation: passive and battery-enabled. Passive tags collect the necessary energy from the antenna of the reader, which can be fixed or portable. Battery-enabled tags fall into two major groupings: battery-assisted passive (BAP) technology and active RFID tag technology."
RFID READER,2,1,"An RFID reader is a radio frequency device that emits a signal through an antenna. This signal is received by RFID tags that respond to interrogation by the reader. Responses are read by the reader, and through a variety of protocols the reader can communicate with all the RFID tags in its field. Readers generally take three forms. Portal readers are fixed in one location; RFID tags pass through them and communicate with the reader. Handheld readers are portable devices that can communicate with RFID tags. Mounted readers are a special type, placed on mobile equipment such as forklifts and cranes. They often communicate with tags in fixed locations."
RFID TAG,2,1,The processing device used in an RFID system that uniquely identifies an object.
RFID TAGS,2,1,"RFID tags are generally small devices that respond to an RFID readerÇs interrogation via radio frequency. Tags vary in terms of memory, the range over which they can be read, the level of read and write capabilities, and the availability of other computational functions. The tag can hold just a productÇs serial number all the way up to a mass of information about the product and its history.  Passive RFID: A passive RFID tag has no battery. It harvests all its power from the radio interrogation of the RFID reader, including enough power to respond. This yields fairly low-cost devices, but they can be read only at a fairly short range (about 20 feet in the best operating conditions). Active RFID: Active tags have batteries attached to them so that they can respond to a reader with more power. They are much more expensive than passive tags but have a much-greater range (up to 300 feet). Smart Cards: Contactless smart cards are often referred to as RFID tags. From a technical perspective, they are just a specially packaged form of RFID tags. Sensors: RFID tags donÇt tell you anything about their environment. They can only tell you what is in the memory of the tag. However, a common application of RFID is to attach the tag to a sensor that can fill the tagÇs memory with data. This is then communicated to other systems through RFID protocols. The sensory technology, while intertwined with RFID, is independent."
RFP,2,0,"A request for proposal (RFP) is both the process and documentation used in soliciting bids for potential business or IT solutions required by an enterprise or government agency.

VERY SMALL APERTURE TERMINAL,2,1,"A very small aperture terminal (VSAT) is a small-sized earth station used in the transmit/receive of data, voice and video signals over a satellite communication network, excluding broadcast television. A VSAT consists of two parts: a transceiver placed outdoors in direct line of sight to the satellite, and a device that is placed indoors to interface the transceiver with the end userís communications device, such as a PC. The transceiver receives or sends a signal to a satellite transponder in the sky. The satellite sends and receives signals from a ground station computer that acts as a hub for the system. Each end user is interconnected with the hub station via the satellite, forming a star topology. The hub controls the entire operation of the network. For one end user to communicate with another, each transmission must first go to the hub station, which then retransmits it via the satellite to the other end userís VSAT. VSAT data throughput speeds have increased significantly throughout the years and now can provide multimegabit service in downstream and upstream. Antenna/dish sizes usually range from 1.2 meters to approximately 3 meters in diameter. Generally, these systems operate in Ku-band and C-band frequencies, but with the launch of Ka-band satellites by a number of operators in North America and Asia/Pacific, and with newer Ka-band satellites planned for Europe, high-bandwidth, bidirectional VSAT services for enterprise, government and other users will increasingly migrate to these satellites."

Virtual tape may also be used as part of a storage area network (SAN) where less-frequently used or archived data can be managed by a single virtual tape server for a number of networked computers. A virtual tape system offloads from the main computer the processing involved in deciding whether data should be available in the faster disk cache or written onto a tape cartridge. The virtual tape system also can manage data so that more of the space on a tape cartridge is actually used.

VSAT,2,0,"A very small aperture terminal (VSAT) is a small-sized earth station used in the transmit/receive of data, voice and video signals over a satellite communication network, excluding broadcast television. A VSAT consists of two parts: a transceiver placed outdoors in direct line of sight to the satellite, and a device that is placed indoors to interface the transceiver with the end userÇs communications device, such as a PC. The transceiver receives or sends a signal to a satellite transponder in the sky. The satellite sends and receives signals from a ground station computer that acts as a hub for the system. Each end user is interconnected with the hub station via the satellite, forming a star topology. The hub controls the entire operation of the network. For one end user to communicate with another, each transmission must first go to the hub station, which then retransmits it via the satellite to the other end userÇs VSAT. VSAT data throughput speeds have increased significantly throughout the years and now can provide multimegabit service in downstream and upstream. Antenna/dish sizes usually range from 1.2 meters to approximately 3 meters in diameter. Generally, these systems operate in Ku-band and C-band frequencies, but with the launch of Ka-band satellites by a number of operators in North America and Asia/Pacific, and with newer Ka-band satellites planned for Europe, high-bandwidth, bidirectional VSAT services for enterprise, government and other users will increasingly migrate to these satellites."
